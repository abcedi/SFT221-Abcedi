To test the function for gathering customer information, especially to ensure that blank
lines were not entered, I implemented a loop withing the promptInput() function. 
This loop repeatedly requests input from the user until a non empty string is entered.
The key here was to check if the first character in the input buffer is a newline character,
which indicated that the Enter key was pressed without any input.

If I had to test that the correct prompts were produced by the program for blank lines,
I would approach it by simulating user inputs programmatically.
This could involve writing a test script that sends both valid and invalid (empty) inputs to the function
and then checks the output or the response of the function. The script would verify that for every invalid input,
the program correctly reprompts the user for input. This kind of testing would likelt involve more advanced
testing techniques, possibly intergrating an automation framework that can mimic user interactions more accurately.
